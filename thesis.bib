  abstract      = {In this Letter, we propose a novel strategy for significantly enhancing the heat transfer in convection turbulence. By introducing a boundary deformation of the standing-wave type, flow modulation can be realized when the amplitude is comparable or larger than the boundary-layer thickness. For a fixed moderate frequency, the entire fluid layer follows the boundary motion at small wave numbers, while only the near-wall regions are affected by the boundary deformation at large wave numbers. The heat-flux enhancement happens for the latter. For a fixed wave number and gradually increasing frequency, the vortical flows inside the wave valleys exhibit nonlinear transition and alter the distribution of boundary heat flux, and the global heat flux increases significantly at large enough frequencies. The current findings suggest that oscillating deformations of boundary can efficiently break the boundary layers, which serves as the bottleneck of global heat transfer, and open a new venue for modulating the convection turbulence.},
